# Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

## 1.Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1- Reduce cost in the long run

2- Make the code better in the long term by setting the standards before you start writing the code.

3- Spend less time on debugging as you must meet the tests before you try the code.

## 2.In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

before each are the things that you want to happen before a test starts and after each for things to happen after the test

## 3.What is one downside of Test Driven Development

It will take a longer time to get to a "first result".

## 4.Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

I think that the syntax of the ES6 classes are way easier than the syntax of constructor.

## 5.Name a use case for a static method
We can use the method without needing to make a new object.


## Terms
* Functional Programming: its building software by using pure functions.

* Pure functions: A function that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in and got no side effects like unnecessary requests.

* Higher order function: its a function that can take another function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

* Immutable state: its a state that cannot be changed.

* Object: they are containers for namedvalues called properties, or methods if they are a "function".

* Object Oriented Programming: It's a programming way that is organized around objects as the source of its data.

* Test Driven Development: Its the process of turning requirments into tests and that you need to pass those tests in your program.

* Unit testing: its a process by whhich you test an individual units of source code.

* Continuous Integration: Its a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repo that can be verified by an automated build.

* Jest: its a javascript testing framework.
