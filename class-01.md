## 1-Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

* When you run a code in the browser, it means you are using the browser itself for the code execution which means you are interacting with the browser itself and the results can be shown on the page or in the console, and when you run it outside a browser then you are using nodeJS to execute your code in server side, which is useful for backend programming, and you can see the results in the console.
